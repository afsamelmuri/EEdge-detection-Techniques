## ðŸ§  **Overview of Techniques**
Edge detection is a critical operation in image processing, aiming to identify points in an image where brightness changes sharply. This repository demonstrates various methods for detecting edges using convolution, gradient-based techniques, and zero-crossing methods.

Each technique has its strengths and is useful for different applications. The Python implementations provided here are tailored for images, but can also be adapted for video processing.

### 1. **Sobel Edge Detection**
The Sobel operator detects edges by calculating the gradient of pixel intensity in both the horizontal and vertical directions. It applies a convolution operation using a Sobel kernel. 

```python
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
sobel_x = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)
sobel_y = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)
